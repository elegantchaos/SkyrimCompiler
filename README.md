# SkyrimFileFormat

This is a very early work-in-progress.

The objective is to product a library (and command line tool), which can take a directory structure composed of text "source" files, and compile it into an `.esp` file. The reverse direction (`.esp` to source) is also an essential step and will be supported.

Given the complexity of the format, the initial goal is not to support direct editing of every single record type.

Parsing of specific record and field types will be slowly expanded, but a fallback option will take the binary content of unknown fields and convert them to/from hex-encoded text.

The advantage of this approach is that round-tripping can be implemented quite cheaply (it is already working, in fact), whereas full support for every single field and record type will take months or years of work.
